# Quran API Client Library 

This project is an **unofficial** Rust client library for interacting with the [AlQuran Cloud API](https://alquran.cloud/api). It allows users to fetch various Quran text and audio editions programmatically, including translations and recitations.

Please note that this library is **not an official** implementation and is **not yet finished**. Development is ongoing, and additional features and improvements will be added continuously.


Feel free to **open an issue** if you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for improvement!
